title: "This Wednesday at SLUUG: \"See Vim Run. Run, Vim, Run!\""
---

Come see me present **See Vim Run. Run, Vim, Run!** at
[SLUUG](http://sluug.org/) this Wednesday, August 12th at
6:30pm. Here's what it's about:

> Vim is packed with features, but by design, it doesn't try to
> do everything. Fortunately, Vim makes it easy to call on other
> programs for help. We'll take a look at the many different
> (and sometimes surprising) ways Vim can run other programs so
> that their features effectively become part of Vim.

I'll post the slides here after I give the talk (and after
I've, you know, created them).

Hope to see you there!
