title: "The Return of \"Efficient Editing with Vim\""
---

_(A day may come when this blog isn't non-stop Vim... but it is not this day.)_

Before people learned not to mention Vim near me for fear of having a much longer conversation than they'd originally intended, they'd often ask how to get started using Vim. After this happened a few times, I built a "starter kit" message that I'd send out, full of advice and links to help them get going quickly with a minimum of frustration.

One of my favorite articles in this kit was Jonathan McPherson's "Efficient Editing with Vim." It did a good, no-nonsense job explaining several key aspects of Vim, and had an up-front emphasis on motions that I really liked.

Unfortunately, Jonathan's site disappeared from the web a while back, and the article along with it. I thought it might've just been moved to a new host, but searches against key phrases mostly came up empty. I _was_ able to find an updated email address, however, so I crossed my fingers and sent Jonathan a note:

> Hi. Sorry to bother you out of the blue, but I was hoping you could
> tell me if there's an official home for your "Efficient Editing With
> Vim" article.
>
> I can still get the text from archive.org, and I found a couple of
> copies of it on random websites, but none of them looked like
> something you control. I'd really like to send people to the right
> place.

I'm happy to report that Jonathan responded a couple of days later, and kindly offered to rehost the article on Github pages. You can now find it here...

...where it will hopefully live a long and happy life. Thanks, Jonathan!
