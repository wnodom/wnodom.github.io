title: "Slides from \"See Vim Run. Run, Vim, Run!\""

About a week ago, I presented a talk at the
[SLUUG](http://sluug.org/) monthly meeting about all the ways
(well, many of the ways) you can use external commands from Vim.
Here's an expanded and annotated PDF version of the slides I used
during the presentation:

Shoot me an email if you have any questions or comments.
