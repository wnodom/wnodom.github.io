I travel a lot these days (mostly for [Angular Boot Camp](http://angularbootcamp.com/), but sometimes just for fun, and usually for both at the same time). I'd like to meet more folks in the places I visit, so this is an attempt to make it easier for those folks to know where I'll be and when I'll be there.

| From        | Until       | Where
|:------------|:------------|:-
| 2017-Sep-08 | 2017-Sep-10 | Chicago, Illinois
| 2017-Sep-12 | 2017-Sep-16 | New Orleans, Louisiana
| 2017-Sep-17 | 2017-Sep-20 | Tacoma, Washington
| 2017-Sep-21 | 2017-Sep-23 | Portland, Oregon

[Get in touch](/contact/) if we'll be in the same place (or close enough) at the same time. I'd love to meet you!
