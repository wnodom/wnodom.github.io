I travel a lot these days (mostly for [Angular Boot Camp](http://angularbootcamp.com/), but sometimes just for fun, and usually for both at the same time). I'd like to meet more folks in the places I visit, so this is an attempt to make it easier for those folks to know where I'll be and when I'll be there.

| From        | Until       | Where
|:------------|:------------|:-
| 2017-Jun-06 | 2017-Jun-11 | Bloomington, Illinois
| 2017-Jun-15 | 2017-Jun-22 | New York City, New York
| 2017-Jul-09 | 2017-Jul-13 | Bay Area, California (San Francisco)
| 2017-Jul-26 | 2017-Jul-28 | Chicago, Illinois

[Get in touch](/contact/) if we'll be in the same place (or close enough) at the same time. I'd love to meet you!
