I travel a lot these days (mostly for [Angular Boot Camp](http://angularbootcamp.com/), but sometimes just for fun, and usually for both at the same time). I'd like to meet more folks in the places I visit, so this is an attempt to make it easier for those folks to know where I'll be and when I'll be there.

| From        | Until       | Where
|:------------|:------------|:-
| 2018-Feb-21 | 2018-Feb-22 | San Francisco Bay Area, California (tentative)
| 2018-Mar-04 | 2018-Mar-10 | San Francisco Bay Area, California
| 2018-Apr-17 | 2018-Apr-21 | Salt Lake City, Utah for [ng-conf](https://ng-conf.com)
| 2018-May-07 | 2018-May-12 | Budapest, Hungary for [Craft Conference](https://craft-conf.com)

[Get in touch](/contact/) if we'll be in the same place (or close enough) at the same time. I'd love to meet you!
