I travel a lot these days (mostly for [Angular Boot Camp](http://angularbootcamp.com/), but sometimes just for fun, and usually for both at the same time). I'd like to meet more folks in the places I visit, so this is an attempt to make it easier for those folks to know where I'll be and when I'll be there.

| From        | Until       | Where
|:------------|:------------|:-
| 2019-Jan-19 | 2019-Jan-20 | Springfield, Missouri, USA
| 2019-Jan-22 | 2019-Jan-26 | Madison, Wisconsin, USA
| 2019-Jan-27 | 2019-Feb-01 | San Francisco, California, USA
| 2019-May-07 | 2019-May-10 | Budapest, Hungary (for the [CRAFT Conference](https://craft-conf.com/))

[Get in touch](/contact/) if we'll be in the same place (or close enough) at the same time. I'd love to meet you!
