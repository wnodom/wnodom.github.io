I travel a lot these days (mostly for [Angular Boot Camp](http://angularbootcamp.com/), but sometimes just for fun, and usually for both at the same time). I'd like to meet more folks in the places I visit, so this is an attempt to make it easier for those folks to know where I'll be and when I'll be there.

| From        | Until       | Where
|:------------|:------------|:-
| 2018-Aug-12 | 2018-Aug-15 | San Francisco, California, USA
| 2018-Aug-16 | 2018-Aug-19 | Andalusia, Alabama, USA

| 2018-Nov-06 | 2018-Aug-07 | London, England (for [AngularConnect](https://angularconnect.com/))

[Get in touch](/contact/) if we'll be in the same place (or close enough) at the same time. I'd love to meet you!
