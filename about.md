Sometimes people ask for a bio, and then I send them a paragraph like this:

> Bill Odom has been a software designer, developer, or systems architect for
> over two decades. For the last several years, he's served as a consultant,
> trainer, and senior software developer for organizations large and small all
> across the US. These days, he divides his time between building large,
> complex web applications, and training others to build large, complex web
> applications.
