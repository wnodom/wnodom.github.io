Sometimes people ask for a bio, and then I send them a paragraph like this:

> Bill Odom has been a software designer, developer, or systems architect for
> three decades. For the last several years, heâ€™s served as a consultant,
> trainer, and senior software developer for organizations large and small all
> across the US and beyond, working on everything from wiki software for
> scrappy Internet startups to all-encompassing identity management solutions
> for global corporations. (He even briefly served as the president of a
> prominent Open Source foundation... but then he came to his senses.) These
> days, he divides his time between building large, complex web applications,
> and teaching other people how to build large, complex web applications.
